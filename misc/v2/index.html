        <h1>Welcome to my little corner of the web.</h1>
        <p>My name is Kirsten and I live in Copenhagen, Denmark. I used to live in MÃ¼nchen, Germany, and before that, I lived in good ol' New Jersey aka the "Armpit of the America." But I liked living there.</p>

        <p>Currently, I work at Microsoft as a Software Engineer. I like to give Brown Bags, air drum in between code compilation, and deliver some solid business requirements each sprint. Not all heroes wear capes.</p>

        <p>I don't have too much information for you right now, but maybe check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirstenrauffer/">linkedin</a> if you want to learn more about me. If you're not feeling that, then just drop me a line via my <a href="mailto:kirstenrauffer@gmail.com?subject=what up Kirsten!">email</a>. We can do a collab and make some cool stuff.</p>
