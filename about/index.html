          I've always loved the place where code + art meet. It's the closest thing to creating magic; the ability to turn a person's wildest imaginations into practical realities. In my work, I aim to create <strong>delightful experiences for all</strong> users. I advocate for <b>accessible</b> and <b>inclusive design</b>. Originally trained as an Electrical Engineer, I weave practicality with aesthetics to create end-to-end applications that users enjoy interacting with.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently a <b>User Interface Engineer</b> at <b>LinkedIn</b>, where I was based in Silicon Valley in <b>Northern California (USA)</b>. Currently, I'm lucky enough to be working remotely while I cozy up in the Windy City of <b>Chicago (USA)</b>. I've previously worked at <b>Microsoft</b> in <b>Copenhagen (Denmark)</b> where I explored Scandinavia, kayaked the fjords, and learned the meaning of hygge.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my expertise in web development and design, I've worked on mobile application development and design during my days as an expat</b>; projects have ranged from <a href="https://www.linova.de/en/projekt/neptune-diabetes-app">published applications</a> to <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8329646">proof-of-concept applications</a> fueling Ph.D research. I've traveled for projects in cities around the globe, my farthest travel for a project being to <b>Saint Petersburg (Russia)</b>. When I wasn't working, I was getting lost in the <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-much-time-would-it-take-to-see-the-entire-Hermitage-Museum-in-Saint-Petersburg">Hermitage</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I can't say that I'm an <i>interesting</i> person, I can say that I am an <i>interested</i> person. Curious, and always learning. I have a love for photography, pottery, wood working, and lately, creating custom key caps. I've dabbled as a <a href="https://soe.rutgers.edu/story/national-engineers-week-photo-competition-winners">luthier</a>. I scuba dive, trek when I can, and try to satisfy the insatiable travel bug as often as possible.
        </p>

          Feel free to poke around in my little corner of the World Wide Web. If you're interested in working together, reach out. This Jersey girl will get it done.
